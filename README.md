# sql-challenge

A new repository called sql-challenge and a new directory called EmployeeSQL within [GitHub](/../main/EmployeeSQL)

Designed tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the six CSVs into a SQL database, and analysed the data. 

Data Engineering/Modeling:

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using a tool 'http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com' with data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. 

The ERD can be found here ![ERD](/../main/EmployeeSQL/ERD.png) and a screenshot from the tool used can be found here ![ERD Screenshot](/../main/EmployeeSQL/ERD_screenshot.png). 

This information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files in PosgreSQL. [Table Schema](/../main/EmployeeSQL/table_schemata.sql)

Data Analysis:
Sql queries formulated to analyse the 8 questions. The solution can be found here [Analysis of SQL queries](/../main/EmployeeSQL/analysis_queries.sql)

BONUS:
The SQL database is imported into Pandas and analysed whether the salary data is fake. The findings are in [Bonus SQLAlchemy](/../main/EmployeeSQL/bonus_sqlalchemy.ipynb). 

The employee ID number is 499942 but this name is for April Foolsday?
