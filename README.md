# sql-challenge

I have created a new repository called sql-challenge and made a new directory called EmployeeSQL in [GitHub](/../main/EmployeeSQL)

In this assignment, we designed tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the six CSVs into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. 

Data Engineering/Modeling:
I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using a tool 'http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com' with data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. The ERD can be found here [ERD](/../main/EmployeeSQL/ERD.png) and a screenshot from the tool used can be found here [ERD Screenshot](/../main/EmployeeSQL/ERD_screenshot.png). I used this information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. [Table Schema](/../main/EmployeeSQL/table_schemata.sql)

Data Analysis:
I have formulated sql queries to analyse the 8 questions. The solution can be found here [Analysis of SQL queries](/../main/EmployeeSQL/analysis_queries.sql)

BONUS:
I've imported the SQL database into Pandas and analysed whether the salary data is fake. My findings are in [Bonus SQLAlchemy](/../main/EmployeeSQL/bonus_sqlalchemy.jpynb). My employee ID number is 499942 but this name is for April Foolsday?
