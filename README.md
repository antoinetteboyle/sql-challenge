# sql-challenge
Data Engineering/Modeling and Analysis:
In this assignment, we designed tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the six CSVs into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data.

I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using a tool [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com) with data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.


I have created a new GitHub repository for this project called `sql-challenge.
